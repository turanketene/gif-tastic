# gif-tastic

## Description

In this assignment, we are instructed to use the GIPHY API to create a dynamic web page that fills the page with the gifs of our choice. 

## Directions

The page will automatically load with buttons to click on to generate gifs. You can also enter a term into the search box. Once the term is entered into the search box, buttons will appear above with the term entered and gifs related to that term will appear below once it is clicked. If you are not sure of a term to search then feel free to select one of the already populated buttons on the page.

There is no specific theme associated with this assignment, so users can search any term of their choice.

The page is deployed @ https://turanketene.github.io/gif-tastic/
